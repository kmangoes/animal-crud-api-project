        This page is an about page for my Static Web App Assignment in my CSC-340 class. I've used a combination of HTML and CSS to create simple, static pages, linked together to create a cohesive (yet simple) website. <br><br>
        I've enjoyed this assignment because I get to sharpen my front-end development skills in a fun way. Getting to talk about my dog Benny has made it even more enjoyable! <br><br>
        As far as actual elements of using HTML/CSS for this assignment, creating the animal form was my favorite part. Being limited to only using HTML/CSS has both made me excited for and realized the boundaries that JavaScript can surpass when combined with simple webpages. It can greatly enrich a user's experience with even just a few modifications.
